### History

As far as I can corroborate, this is the very rough timeline of development of the DragonSlayer Edition:

* 2002: MightyE starts development.
* 2003: First version released under the GPLv2
* 2003: JT Traub joins the effort.
* May 2003: Release of 0.9.7, the final GPLv2 release.
* July - August 2003: Anpera translates the game to german, ultimately starting the "0.9.7+jt ext (GER)" line of development
* August 2004: Release of 0.9.8-prerelease, leading to a split of the 0.9.7 forks from the mainline project[1]
* September 2004: Last bundled release of "0.9.7+jt ext (GER)"
* 2004: DragonSlayer starts the "Drachenserver", which later became Atrahor
* Mid 2006: Release of the DragonSlayer Edition V/2.5
* April 2009: Release of the DragonSlayer Edition V/3.0
* February 2016: Release of the DragonSlayer Edition V/3.5
* July 2021: Artrahor shuts down.
